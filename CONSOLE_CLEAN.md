## Console Output (What You'll See)

✅ **Service Worker registered** - Working perfectly  
✅ **No icon errors** - Icons are embedded  
✅ **PWA manifest loaded** - With SVG icons  
❌ Chrome extension errors - Still present (but harmless, from your browser plugins)

---

## Remaining Console "Errors" (Ignorable)

These are **NOT errors in your application**:

1. `Denying load of chrome-extension://...` 
   - Your browser's password manager trying to inject code
   - Completely harmless
   - Doesn't affect functionality

2. `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: chrome-extension://...`
   - Browser extension loading failure (not your code)
   - Doesn't affect functionality

**These can be safely ignored. They're from browser plugins, not your app.**
