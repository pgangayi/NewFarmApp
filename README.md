# Farmers Boot — Master Documentation

This repository's documentation has been consolidated into a single master document to simplify maintenance.

See the consolidated documentation here:

- `docs/README.md` — Master documentation (API, setup guides, policies, audit reports).

If you need a previously archived document, check `archive/docs-originals/` (archived originals after consolidation).

Quick start:

- Development: `npm run dev` (frontend) and `npm run dev:functions` (backend with Wrangler)
- Tests: `npm run test` (frontend/tests), `npm run test:integration` (backend)

For any documentation edits, update `docs/README.md` and propose a PR.
